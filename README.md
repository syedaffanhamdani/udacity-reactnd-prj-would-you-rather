# Would you rather

This is a project that I made as part of my Udacity Nano Degree to master basics of redux

## Functionality and features

Project basically conducts a poll about would you rather do option 1 or option 2. 

Users have option to add polls and see the results in a leader board.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
